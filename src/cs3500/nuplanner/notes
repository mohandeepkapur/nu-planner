/*
  every event needs unique and immutable identifier
  user will of course use view to make sense of model-stuff (samegame unplayable without view)
  issue: how can client refer to an event it wants to remove/modify?
         client will need to provide a user-name, to access relevant schedule
         client will need to provide X to access relevant event
   */


   key <-- storing refs to same event obj in multiple schedules

   removeEvent(user, eventID) {

    extract relevant schedule
    extract event using eventID from rel. schedule (store in temp ref)

    if (owner of event is user) then removeEvent(pass in temp ref)

   }



   removeEvent(Event temp) {
    given temp
    for all events in Events:
        if temp == you
            remove you from list
   }


   want to get all of core functionality down --> then add in IAE ISE checks
   assume all input given into model is perfect



       // or, invitees added --> whenever new user created, that user's sched is automaticaly populated with events it was invited to
       // if even one invitee has a schedule conflict, throw an error
       // can host remove invitee



   if user wants to create an event with an invitee that does not exist... model does not allow
   if XML wants to create event with invitee does not exist... model will load that user into the system
