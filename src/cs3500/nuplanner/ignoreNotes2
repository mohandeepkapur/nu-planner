ISchedulingSystemView impl by SchedulingSystem Frame

Clicking certain button on SchedulingSystem Frame --> will instantiate EventFrame


View is SS Frame, and instantiate/dispose of EventFrames within it



View has a read-only model


If View does not need to change model-state, does not need to go through Features!!!! No point
No need to request something that doesn't change model-state




Event Frame


IMPORTANT
modifyEventButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
      @Override
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
        // print out modify-event details
        // System.out.print(availableUsersList.getSelectedValue()); //null if nothing selected
        if (areInputsBlank()) {

        } else {
          System.out.println("MODIFYING EVENT...");
          System.out.println("Modifier of event: " + eventFrameOpenerUser);
          // need to be able to detect modified invitee list when printing out contents
          // if user selected, and user is invitee of event
          // remove invitee from copyEvent list (if host, remove all invitees)
          // view shouldn't be creating/modifying events <- request from features with all user inputs
              // then features produces copy, updates copy, and then calls modify on og
              // and copy event
          printEventDetails();
        }

        // copy og event // perform modifications
        // send to modifyEvent(new, old) -> swap out old for new event
        // performing modifications means just pulling from user input

        // copyOfCreateEvent();

        // if selected user is invitee of event, remove invitee
        // if selected user is not invitee, add invitee
        // if no user has been selected, do nothing
        // if name has been changed

        // create new Event, and send it to model (via f)
        // modifyEvent(old Event, new Event)
      }
    });
