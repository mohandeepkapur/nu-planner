The interfaces we were given were not particularly flexible on certain aspects.

The view was decently capable, but broken up into disjointed parts rather than unified under a
single interface which made adaption challenging.

Code reuse was a little challenging on our providers end, as while they fixed items as we went,
sometimes integration into the rest of their code didn't follow and was a work in progress.

The code presented was decently clean, but the Javadocs occasionally left us confused, wondering how
they were implemented or what the proper use and other side effects were.

We requested many changes from the providers. They were initially missing many of the interfaces
needed for us to adapt their code, lacking an interface for Event, User, Schedule, and more.
Furthermore, there were no explicit throw exceptions noted, which while not of immediate importance,
another minor roadblock.
