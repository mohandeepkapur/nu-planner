Overall, there were many design decisions we made that helped our process and made the adaption
struggle for our providers easier. There were no major updates made for our customers, aside from
answering clarifying questions and providing our wrapper event class so that they could properly
integrate our strategies. Fortunately, thanks to our decently flexible design, the process was
straightforward and strong lesson in smart design.

Our experience with providers was great, as they were super nice, responsive, and fixed many of the
issues we presented. They also were always around to answer clarifying questions, and overall the
experience working with them was good.
