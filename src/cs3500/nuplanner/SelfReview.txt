Self Review:

Looking back on our early design decisions, we wish we didn't choose to couple our representation
of Time wasn't coupled to an Event. Luckily, for these series of projects, that flawed decision
hasn't posed an issue. Otherwise, I believe we stuck to good object-oriented design principles:
no implementation-specific coupling, high cohesion for each component, client reliance on
abstractions, good and forward-thinking interface design.

No updates were needed for our customers. Hopefully that is a good sign.

Our experience with our providers was positive; they were nice, responsive, and fulfilled most of
our requests. Overall, the experience working with them was good.
