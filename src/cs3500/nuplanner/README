design decisions:
- eventIDs are not fixed <- helps user get their bearings

- same event obj can be contained in multiple schedules

- view will rely on Schedule and Event interfaces (good, bad?) <-- S + E tech part of Model

- assuming users can modify timing of an event (mult schedules or not)
- invitees that don't have accounts will have accounts made for them
    (avoiding specific bug)
- can I say that the timing of an event cannot be modified?
^ don't need to cover case where modfying event could cause
  scheduling conflicts that prev did not exist
- XML question -->



- a user can be BOTH event owner AND event invitee (only one)
