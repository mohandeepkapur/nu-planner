ISchedulingSystemView impl by SchedulingSystem Frame

Clicking certain button on SchedulingSystem Frame --> will instantiate EventFrame


View is SS Frame, and instantiate/dispose of EventFrames within it



View has a read-only model


If View does not need to change model-state, does not need to go through Features!!!! No point
No need to request something that doesn't change model-state




Event Frame


IMPORTANT

          // if user selected, and user is invitee of event
          // remove invitee from copyEvent list (if host, remove all invitees)
          // view shouldn't be creating/modifying events <- request from features with all user inputs
              // then features produces copy, updates copy, and then calls modify on og
              // and copy event
          printEventDetails();
        }

        // copy og event // perform modifications
        // send to modifyEvent(new, old) -> swap out old for new event
        // performing modifications means just pulling from user input

        // copyOfCreateEvent();

        // if selected user is invitee of event, remove invitee
        // if selected user is not invitee, add invitee
        // if no user has been selected, do nothing
        // if name has been changed

                                           //event-frame needs to be aware of who opened frame?

    If model worked with Events instead of start-day/start-time

ModifyEvent utilizing Events <- necessary
RemoveEvent utilizing startDay, startTime <- could take in Event too?

- what if used Events instead of startday, starttime
- if wanted to  remove events that shared startdaystartday
    - as long as client had way to access specific event to remove
        from model
    - model could remove that event
- using startday, starttime as signature for model operation methods
  enforces interface-level constraint that scheduling-system
    - CANNOT deal with Events that start at the same time
- unique identifier of an Event is the entire Event itself, not just its startday and time

reasoning for moving from start-day/start-time to Event
- for remove: adds slight bit of flexibility to model
    - if we change how event-conflicts defined by a schedule, remove constraint from
           schedule that events within schedule must have unique start days/times
- for modifyEvent: need to, to allow user to perform multiple mods at once
    - issues w/ current event signature discussed
- for eventConflict: will not move, responsibility of creating events is solely models
    checking for eventConflicts within scheduling system may require creation of new event
     - which must be model's responsibility
also, if modifyEvent making switch, would be nice for removeEvent to change for consistency

// Event just container for attendees
// special actions if "host" removed handled by model

Biggest drawback <- not having a time-class and user-class
would've made codebase so much more flexible
codebase then could've easily worked with different time representations

/*
purpose of adapters -> adapting
adapters wise, what am I stuck on? like, if I have library 1 that works with type2
and i have type1impl -> I can adapt type1impl to type2 so I can get output from library 1
then whatever i do with that output, up to me

problem: I want to make code that uses incompatible interface work with existing interface, so it can do shit
solution: adapter design pattern
 */

GUIController -> do not want to change code

want to adapt client's features w mine
like, I want to leave my code unchanged

take perspective of, what does their view need to work

as of right now, there's no way for my GUIController to work with their view
    because they don't have an overarching view interface

so, I want to be able to use my GUIController as is
    - which means I need to translate my model interface which GUIController uses, to a model interface their View understands
    - need to translate my view interface,
    - their features interface, I need to translate into my features
    -
